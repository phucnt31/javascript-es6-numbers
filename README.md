## Introduction

- The Numbers project demonstrates the application of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features by creating a dynamic project that showcases numbers increasing in real-time. It utilizes ES6 syntax and concepts to create a visually appealing interface where numbers such as Succeeded Projects, Working Hours Spent, or Happy Clients increase continuously at a millisecond interval.
